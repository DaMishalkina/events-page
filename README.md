This page provides information about the concerts. It has sorting fields (implemented as select elements) and event cards.
The layout is made for desktop screens. When the width of the screen is changed, the elements decrease proportionally.

The concert data is in the events.json file of this repository.
The default values of all sorting fields are set to "All", and by default the page displays cards with all events.

Sorting of events is possible:
 - by country;
 - by month (all events are presented for 2019, search is performed only by month).
